 A cryptographic system involving symmetric and asymmetric cryptography


## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop an encryption system involving both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.

## Summary of Features:
* The user can choose which encryption method to use (Symmetric or Asymmetric).
* DES algorithm should be used for the symmetric encryption option.
* RSA algorithm should be used for the asymmetric encryption option.
* For both options:
  - The user can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message.
  - The user must input the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
  - In addition to the message, the user must provide the key (in the case of RSA, only the two prime numbers needed for key generation can be provided).

## Development:
The algorithm will be developed using the Java programming language.
